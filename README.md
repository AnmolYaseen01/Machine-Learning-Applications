# Machine Learning Applications

This repository, "Machine-Learning-Applications," provides practical implementations of machine learning applications and concepts. Below is an overview of the available files:

## Notebooks

### 1. Building_Logistic_Regression_from_scratch_in_Python.ipynb
This notebook demonstrates the manual implementation of logistic regression from scratch in Python.

### 2. Using_Sk-learn_To_Build_Linear_Regression_Model.py
The file, previously named "Using_Sk-learn_To_Build_Linear_Regression_Model.py," is now appropriately renamed to "Using_Sk-learn_To_Build_Linear_Regression_Model.ipynb." It involves building a linear regression model using the scikit-learn library.

### 3. model eveluation using cross_val_score.py
A script for evaluating machine learning models using cross-validation scores.

### 4. preprocessing data - z_score normalization.ipynb
This notebook focuses on data preprocessing, specifically Z-score normalization.

### 5. visualizing regression line using scatter plot.ipynb
The notebook provides insights into visualizing a regression line using a scatter plot.

Feel free to explore these notebooks to gain practical insights into various machine learning applications and techniques!
